Vidmask - Large dataset for Facemask detection along with tool for social distance measurement. 



ViDmask link : 



Each model in this paper is trained using custom dataset :ViDmask.
All the models have their pretrained models used for transfer learning. The config files in each were modified to accomodate the custom dataset 
That is number of classes =2 and the classname as ['mask','nomask'].
